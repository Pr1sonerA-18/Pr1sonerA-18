### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
Here are the controls and Scps:
Use the arrow keys to move the D-Class! Your job is to escape the SCP foundation and survive during the breach
SCP - 173: the scuplture, Use SCP - 131, The eye pods to disable SCP - 173
SCP - 106: The old man creates portals to get you other places quickly, but you have to go through a maze
If this project reaches 100 stars, I will release a new update!
Note: this is my first project, so please enjoy!
